# CONCLUSIONS FROM THE ANALYSIS
After analyzing the data, it is clear that if victories in counties were the deciding factor, the 2020 election should have been won by the Republicans and Donald Trump, who achieved this feat in nearly 1,800 counties. However, the issue is that these counties are much less populated, and as a result, the states they belong to have fewer electoral votes. This clearly indicates that winning the U.S. presidential election hinges on securing victories in the largest cities.

The Republican electorate is concentrated in two main areas — the southern states and the central belt stretching from Arkansas to Montana along the Canadian border. The states in this region, with the exception of Texas and (swing-state) Florida, guarantee relatively few electoral votes. This reveals the most significant problem for Republicans in the 2020 presidential election. The root of their defeat lies in the fact that their candidate failed to persuade voters in swing states, which are essential to supplement the traditional, small-town Republican electorate, to secure a victory. Out of the 8 states classified as "Swing States" (defined here as states where the margin of victory was less than 5 percentage points), Republicans won only 2—Florida and North Carolina. If Republicans hope to win the 2024 election, they must certainly fight for the remaining swing states where their losses to the Democrats were within the margin of statistical error, such as Georgia (margin of victory: 0.24 p.p.), Arizona (margin of victory: 0.3 p.p.), Wisconsin (margin of victory: 0.64 p.p.), and additionally Pennsylvania, where the margin was slightly larger (1.18 p.p.) but which, after Florida, has the most electoral votes up for grabs (Florida: 29 votes; Pennsylvania: 20 votes). Winning back these states and holding onto the others would guarantee Republicans 289 electoral votes and victory in the entire election.

For this to happen, Republicans must focus more on large cities and the most populous counties. In 2020, the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, won only in 8 of the largest counties in states "won" by Republicans. Surprisingly, in 16 out of 25 "Republican states," the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, won in their largest cities.

The importance of competing for the urban electorate is further underscored by another statistic—winning the majority of counties in a state does not "make up" for the lack of votes lost in large cities. The Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, in 2020 won the majority of counties in the states he carried only 9 times. In 17 cases, winning in the largest urban centers was enough to secure victory in the entire state. The statistics for the Republican candidate are glaring — he did not win a single state where he did not also win the majority of counties.

On the other hand, the Democrats, aiming to win again, must essentially continue what they have already established—maintain the states they won in 2020 by focusing on the electorate in their largest urban centers. Speaking of Democrats, their electorate is concentrated in 3 regions—the northern part of the East Coast, the entire West Coast, and the Great Lakes area. The most important state in the Democrats' possession is California, which has the largest number of electoral votes in the entire country — 55. Along with Illinois and New York, these states form the core of the Democratic electorate, guaranteeing 104 electoral votes from the start.
